May 15th we partner with Fox Ford Motor for our Driven to Give Spring Block Party event at the school. We're happy to partner with Fox Ford Motor for a family-friendly celebration of spring. We'll have a selection of Lincoln vehicles on-hand for parents to test drive -- with a donation made to the school for each ride taken. Kids of all ages will stay entertained with crafts, games and activities. Sample the delicious options from multiple food cart vendors and even clean out your closet with a clothing collection drive with Unique Thrift Store.
